# Odin-Project-Etch-A-Sketch
To complete this project I will have to apply everything that I've learned so far in the course:

HTML, CSS (Flexbox) and Javascript

I suspect that I will have the most difficulty handling the javascript as it seems to be the most complicated part of this project. That being said, maybe flexbox gives me a hard time as well, we will see!

Either way, I hope you enjoy this little piece of code.
