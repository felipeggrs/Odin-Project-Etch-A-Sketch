# Odin-Project-Etch-A-Sketch
To complete this project I will have to apply everything that I've learned so far in the course:

HTML, CSS (Flexbox) and Javascript

I suspect that I will have the most difficulty handling the javascript as it seems to be the most complicated part of this project. That being said, maybe flexbox gives me a hard time as well, we will see!

Either way, I hope you enjoy this little piece of code.

# UPDATE Mar 14 2023: 

This project is "done". Everything asked during the lesson has been achieved, but I feel like there is much more to be done in this project in the near future:

1. Add buttons to change the color modes (full rainbow, rainbow that gets darker, black only, eraser, etc)
2. Add a bit of sound after each color change, maybe something similar to Civ 5, where you can click the map to make a tune.
3. Add the general layout of the page, with credits, nav menu, etc
